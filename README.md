### Objects in State
Use state setter callback function when our next value depends on our previous value.
copy the previous state into the next state like 

    setProfile((prev)=> (                 ------ these brackets tells JavaScript that our curly brackets 
                                                        ----- refer to a new object to be returned
        {...prev,                         ------ ..., the spread operator fills in the corresponding 
                                                        ----- fields from our previous state
        `[name]`: value}                  ------  overwrites the appropriate key with its updated value
        ));

This is the Computed Property. Name allows us to use the string value stored by the name variable as a property key.

        [name]: value    

const [currentState, stateSetter] = useState( initialState );

The currentState references the current value of the state and initialState initializes the value of the state for the componentâ€™s first render.

The useEffect() function has no return value as the Effect Hook is used to call another function. We pass the callback function, or effect, to run after a component renders as the argument of the useEffect() function. 

define simple event handlers inline in our JSX and complex event handlers outside of our JSX.


### Some effects require cleanup

##### `If useEffect() returns a function, then the Hook always treats that as the cleanup function`

useEffect(() => {
      First Argumet or the EFFECT
  return () => {
        Return statement or CLEAN UP is optional
  };
}, [ Second Argument or DEPENDENCY]);
